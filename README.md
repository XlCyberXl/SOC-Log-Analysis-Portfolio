## Overview
This repository contains hands-on SOC and Incident Response log analysis investigations focused on identifying, validating, and documenting real-world attack techniques using web server logs and SIEM data.

Each project follows a structured SOC workflow:
- Alert or detection review
- Evidence-based log analysis
- Determination of attack success or failure
- Clear, defensible conclusions
- Security recommendations

All investigations are documented step-by-step, with each step mapped to supporting evidence and screenshots.
